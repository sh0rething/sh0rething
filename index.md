## Flipping hell! New Zealand property frenzy as two houses sold five times in four days
Eleanor Ainge Roy, 18 January 2017 - [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/18/flipping-hell-new-zealand-property-frenzy-as-two-houses-sold-five-times-in-four-days), [Archive](https://archive.ph/kPqoP)

An investigation has been launched into how two Auckland homes were sold five times in four days as the practice of “flipping” continues to boom in New Zealand’s largest city and hottest property market. Flipping is loosely defined as properties which are sold twice or more within a single year, and properties sold twice or more within the space of six months raise particular concerns for regulators. 

Kevin Lampen-Smith, chief executive of the Real Estate Agents Authority, said his agency would investigate both transactions because the speed of how quickly they changed hands had raised red flags. “The natural question is if the property has been bought and sold a couple of times and the price keeps on going up, was the initial vendor looked after?,” said Lampen-Smith. “Any time transactions take place very quickly you have increased concern to make sure all parties are fully informed of the decisions they are making.”

Nick Goodall, a senior research analyst for CoreLogic, said while contemporaneous transactions were not illegal there were ethical concerns if unscrupulous developers took advantage of less-educated vendors. Goodall said 7.4% of Auckland property transactions were identified as potential “flips” in 2016, with high net migration and a shortage of housing pushing up prices.

## Goldman Sachs: New Zealand houses most over-valued
Susan Edmunds, 16 May 2017 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/92642259/goldman-sachs-new-zealand-houses-most-overvalued), [Archive](https://archive.ph/F5tOm)

Investment bank Goldman Sachs says there is a 40 per cent chance New Zealand will suffer a housing market "bust" in the next two years. It has put out a report that looks at housing markets in the G-10 countries, according to Bloomberg. It reportedly found New Zealand's was the most over-valued and at risk of correction. But to qualify as a "bust", prices would only have to fall 5 per cent or more, after inflation.

It judged prices over-valued based on the ratio of house prices to rent, the ratio of house prices to household income and house prices adjusted for inflation, Bloomberg said. Property commentator Olly Newland said a 60 per cent chance that there would not be a fall in prices of 5 per cent or more was still good odds for those in the market. He said it seemed more likely that prices would flatten, rather than fall rapidly. There are already signs this is happening in Auckland – Real Estate Institute figures show prices there up only 3 per cent year-on-year in April. 

"A crash would have to be a 20 per cent \[drop in prices\] or more," he said. "You can read the figures any way you like but it's highly unlikely, it's headline grabbing." He said it would take a significant economy-derailing event, either in New Zealand or internationally, to seriously dent house prices.

But Gareth Kiernan, chief forecaster at Infometrics, said Goldman Sachs was being too conservative. He said a 5 per cent fall was "hardly bust territory given where New Zealand is at the moment. It's hard to know with Auckland but in the grand scheme of things they are probably underestimating the probability."

ASB senior economist Chris Tennent-Brown said even a 10 per cent to 15 per cent price fall, it would only take prices back to where they were a year or 18 months ago. "When everyone was writing saying how expensive housing was." "You could have a reasonable correction and what was a $1 million house becomes $900,000. It's still a very expensive home."

## Where NZ ranks now with Chinese real estate buyers: popularity change
Anne Gibson, 22 August 2017 - [NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/where-nz-ranks-now-with-chinese-real-estate-buyers-popularity-change/6GF53EX4XTTX6MFFZ7F3AX6ONI/), [Archive](https://archive.ph/GfI45)

Chinese buyer appetite for New Zealand property remains strong because this country's real estate is "good value", a real estate chief says, but we have slipped in popularity lately. Jane Lu, Australia and New Zealand chief for Chinese real estate business Juwai, said for Chinese buyers, New Zealand ranked as the sixth most popular country globally, behind the United States, Australia, Thailand, Canada and the United Kingdom.

"The fact that we still have so many Chinese buying in New Zealand shows that they still have the money and the interest. When you compare the price of similar property in China and New Zealand, the latter still offers good value," Lu said. "Despite tighter capital controls this year, 57 per cent of Chinese still say they will increase their overseas investments over the next two years, with more than 60 per cent planning to invest specifically in residential real estate," she said. 

In the past two years, property investors reported how bidding at Auckland residential auctions from people based in China has reduced significantly and competition was not as strong. Last year, Juwai said Chinese buyers were showing a growing appetite for New Zealand properties, with inquiries jumping by 50 per cent on Juwai.com, the biggest portal for Chinese searching here for properties.

## Labour governments have overseen greatest house price inflation, data shows
Susan Edmunds, 03 November 2017 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/property/98475352/labour-governments-have-overseen-greatest-house-price-inflation-data-shows), [Archive](https://archive.ph/ffe7A)

New government policies are predicted to put the brakes on an already slowing property market. But data shows that, historically, it has been Labour governments that have overseen New Zealand's biggest house price rises. Data from CoreLogic shows house prices grew 49 per cent from 1990 to 1999, under National-led governments. Then, from 1999 to 2008, prices rose 113 per cent under the last Labour-led government.

 Tony Alexander, BNZ's chief economist, used data back to 1961, which showed the average price rise per annum under governments led by each party. It showed an average rise of 9.1 per cent per year under the National governments, and 16.8 per cent under Labour - or 13.9 per cent excluding the 1972 Labour government period when oil prices soared and inflation was  uncontrolled.

"I would not however take this analysis as providing any reasonable guide as to what is going to happen going forward. It would not be reasonable to expect that if Labour stay in power nine years again that average house prices will rise some 125 per cent to 150 per cent," he said. "In 1992 and again post-GFC we saw a structural decline in the average level of interest rates. Lower financing costs have been factored into house prices and attracted new investors looking for yield. The housing market has internationalised these past three decades so there are new buyers who were not there before. Now few new foreign buyers will come through."

## MBIE figures show nationwide housing shortage of 71,000
Corazon Miller, 03 November 2017 - [NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/mbie-figures-show-nationwide-housing-shortage-of-71000/55NUUYNFWZA3OJTTDCHF7W3T4I/), [Archive](https://archive.ph/Rqg8m)

New Zealand needs 71,000 more houses - more than half of them in Auckland - the country's biggest city. Nationwide Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment figures released to the Herald show there is a shortage of 71,194 houses - 44,738 are needed in Auckland alone. The next biggest housing shortfall was in greater Wellington with a shortage of 9312 properties - less than a quarter of what's needed in Auckland.

The methodology used by MBIE estimated the accumulated housing shortfall in Auckland after assessing the rise in population compared to new houses that have been built. MBIE said the shortage of supply relative to demand had contributed to a large growth in prices, as well as an increase in rents.

The new Labour-led government plans to build 100,000 new homes in the next 10 years with its $2b KiwiBuild scheme. In the coming three years, KiwiBuild aims to gradually ramp up to 10,000 high-quality affordable new residences for first-home buyers per year, half in Auckland. Earlier Phil Twyford told the Herald it would take about three years for the programme to kick into full-strength, starting out at a few hundred or possibly 1000 residences in the first year.

## Auckland's middle class plummeting down property ladder
Dileepa Fonseka, 02 July 2018 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105169816/aucklands-middle-class-plummeting-down-property-ladder), [Archive](https://archive.ph/1ESvt)

Auckland's middle class have seen a huge drop in their ability to own the home of their choice. Auckland Council has released a report _Who can buy Auckland's houses_ \[which\] analyses housing affordability at 10 and 20 per cent deposit rates for different income levels. 

Since 2012 middle income groups had experienced a steep decline in the quality of houses they could afford at their income level.  In 2012 a household earning the median income could afford 48 per cent of the houses in Auckland with a 20 per cent deposit. Five years later they could afford just 18 per cent of houses in the market with a much larger deposit in dollar terms, Norman said. "They're feeling that pain of getting cut out."

Affordability was defined as the ability to use 35 per cent of a household's income to pay for a 30-year mortgage at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's first mortgage new customer housing rate.

Harshal Chitale, Auckland Council senior economist, says their analysis shows middle-class income groups would now even be unable to afford a home at the Kiwibuild cap of $650,000. A household would need to be earning $118,300 a year to afford a $650,000 home with a 10 per cent deposit, he said. The study noted interest rates had changed less than one per cent over that time period so the main changes in affordability were due to price increases. 

Housing affordability has fallen across all income groups according to the study, but the steepest fall was across middle-class income groups. Households in the bottom 35 per cent of incomes are unlikely to be able to buy anything, the study says.

## New Zealand bans sales of homes to foreigners
15 August 2018 - [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45199034), [Archive](https://archive.ph/QDpyF)

New Zealand's parliament has banned many foreigners from buying existing homes in the country - a move aimed at making properties more affordable. The ban only applies to non-residents. Australians and Singaporeans are exempt because of free-trade deals.

New Zealand is facing a housing affordability crisis which has left home ownership out of reach for many. Low interest rates, limited housing stock and immigration have driven up prices in recent years.

They are now banned from purchasing most types of homes - but they will be able to make limited investments in new apartments in large developments. Foreigners with residency status in New Zealand - as well as non-resident Australian and Singaporean nationals - are not affected by the ban.

The ban follows fears that overseas buyers of homes were putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices. Average prices in New Zealand have risen more than 60% in the past 10 years, while in Auckland - the country's largest city - they have almost doubled. In July, the median price for residential property nationwide was NZ$550,000, according to data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand.

## It is not a question of whether Auckland's house prices fall, but by how much: Analyst
Ben Leahy, 16 August 2018 - [NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/it-is-not-a-question-of-whether-aucklands-house-prices-fall-but-by-how-much-analyst/DHYC32PNC7A2MKKO3IIMHWPZ7E/), [Archive](https://archive.ph/SzEtA)

Australasian Trading Management warned investors in its Daily Market Insights home values had "already pulled back significantly" in Australia's hot Sydney and Melbourne markets and the "price correction" was spreading to Auckland. It pointed to figures by Auckland agents Barfoot & Thompson, showing the city's median home value hit $810,000 last month - a 10 per cent fall from the market peak price of $900,000 in March last year.

Fellow analysts CoreLogic and industry lobby the Real Estate Institute of NZ, meanwhile, cautioned median prices were not the best measure of overall home values, and said Auckland house values were holding steady.

ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner told Q+A she was watching the New Zealand market with interest because of what was happening across the ditch. "Another risk has emerged on the horizon and that would be contagion from a more marked slowdown in the Australian housing market than is currently expected," she said.

ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley agreed home values seemed high relative to rents and average incomes and that Government policy changes could hurt prices. But he did not "envisage a material fall" in values. "Auckland house prices have been pretty flat for the last two years, with marginal falls in recent months," he said. "We expect prices to be pretty flat over the next couple of years, with very mild increases or falls possible."

REINZ chief executive Bindi Norwell said Auckland prices had remained stable over the past 15 months rather than fallen. REINZ statistics followed a similar pattern to Barfoot & Thompson's figures with a market peak median Auckland home price of $900,000 in March last year and a median price of $835,000 last month.

## Tight Wellington housing market sees another rise in asking prices
Thomas Manch, 04 September 2018 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/property/106790868/tight-wellington-housing-market-sees-another-rise-in-asking-prices), [Archive](https://archive.ph/6zsuA)

The average asking price for a house in Wellington continues to rise, as the number of houses listed for sale drops. Wellington's average asking price increased 1.7 per cent in August, to $639,553, while some regions have experienced an even sharper rise.

Property website realestate.co.nz, which aggregates a claimed 97 per cent of the country's real estate listings, released August figures for house listings and sales across the country. Of the 19 regions, 11 reached record high average asking prices as the number of houses listed for sale dropped 1.6 per cent in the year to August, to 21,207 for the month.

Realestate.co.nz head of marketing Vanessa Taylor said consistently low housing stock in the capital continued to see an increase in asking prices. "There's nothing to suggest that anything will change too drastically. We haven't had a lot of stock in Wellington and I can't see that changing too much."

## New Zealand median house prices rose 10 percent in 2018
Jamie Ensor, 21 December 2018 - [Newshub](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/12/new-zealand-median-house-prices-rose-10-percent-in-2018.html), [Archive](https://archive.ph/xIqfI)

The Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) has released its year in review, revealing some interesting insights into the market which the organisation's chief executive Bindi Norwell has called "healthy". Between January and November 2018, the national median sale price increased 10.6 percent from $520,000 to $575,000. But that is down from the 11.2 per cent increase that house prices jumped during the same period in 2017.

While the Auckland median sale prices increased 5.7 percent from $820,000 to $867,000, Ms Norwell said the city's market has been stabilising around $850,000 "for some time now" and expects a similar picture next year. Despite the higher prices, nationally there were 72,188 property sales over the period, up 4.2 percent.

She told Newshub the market could be determined as being in a "healthy place" due to the decrease in how long it takes to sell a property. The days to sell across New Zealand decreased 23.9 percent from 46 to 35 days.  The decrease was stronger when Auckland is excluded, down 26.1 percent from 46 days to 34. "This means that it's taking a shorter time to sell properties compared to the same time the previous year, which is indicating that the market is in a healthy place," said Ms Norwell.

## NZ house prices are among the most unaffordable in the world: survey
Susan Edmunds, 21 January 2019 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/110049950/auckland-ranked-among-worlds-least-affordable-cities-in-housing-report), [Archive](https://archive.ph/MqoJX)

New Zealand's house prices are among the most unaffordable in the world, a new survey shows.

The Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey rates housing affordability using the "median multiple", a measure of median house price divided by median household income. Authors Wendell Cox and Hugh Pavletich ranks as affordable cities where the median price is up to three times the median wage. Areas are classed as moderately unaffordable when the ratio is up to four, seriously unaffordable between four and five and severely unaffordable when the ratio is more than five times income.

**Auckland, at nine times income, was severely unaffordable, and up from 5.9 in 2004. Auckland is the seventh-least affordable city of the 91 major housing markets surveyed.** The country as a whole also ranks in this range, with a ratio of 6.5.

"In New Zealand, as in Australia, housing had been affordable until approximately a quarter century ago. However, urban containment policies were adopted across the country, and consistent with the international experience, housing became severely unaffordable in all three of New Zealand's largest housing markets, Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington." New Zealand's price-to-income ratio was below three times in the early 1990s.

BNZ chief economist Tony Alexander said the report was no surprise. "Another January and another Demographia report telling us what we already know. Housing affordability in NZ is poor. And what will ensue is another year in which much discussion will occur about the problem but solutions will again fail to appear. As I have been pointing out for upwards of a decade, there are many factors which account for the structural shift upward in the ratio of average house prices to average household income. "One is low interest rates and recently expectations have shifted to borrowing costs remaining lower for longer. That will help underpin prices. So will the ongoing shortage of people in the construction sector." He expected no change in housing affordability this year.

Many of the KiwiBuild homes already completed are languishing on the market, with many considering NZ$525,000 (£273,000) for a two-bedroom home far from affordable. In Auckland and Queenstown – the two most expensive cities in New Zealand – KiwiBuild houses are capped at NZ$500,00 for a one-bedroom home, NZ$600,000 for a two-bed, and NZ$650,000 for three bedrooms or more.

The authors of the Demographia International Housing Affordability survey class a house as affordable if the median price is up to three times the median wage – **making the government’s KiwiBuild houses “severely unaffordable” for most.**

## New Zealand housing crisis: just 47 'affordable' homes built in six months
Eleanor Ainge Roy, 28 January 2019 - [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/new-zealand-housing-crisis-just-47-affordable-homes-built-in-six-months), [Archive](https://archive.ph/3ybM2)

**Jacinda Ardern’s flagship KiwiBuild policy labelled ‘a failure’ amid delays and claims homes are too expensive**

acinda Ardern’s flagship housing policy is in dire straits after the government admitted it won’t meet its target of building 1,000 affordable homes in its first year – and is set to fall short by 700. New Zealand house prices are among the most unaffordable in the world, with Auckland the seventh most expensive city to buy a home, and all three major cities considered “severely unaffordable” by the latest Demographia international housing affordability survey.

In 2018 the Labour coalition government banned the sale of existing New Zealand homes to overseas buyers and launched its flagship KiwiBuild scheme; aiming to build 100,000 affordable homes in 10 years, with 1,000 of them scheduled for the first year. But since July **just 47 KiwiBuild homes have been completed** – and housing minister Phil Twyford has said the government is unlikely to reach its target of 1,000 by June 2019 – putting the success of the project in jeopardy.

## Average New Zealand house price reaches all-time high 
Alice Webb-Liddall, 01 February 2019 - [Newshub](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/01/average-new-zealand-house-price-reaches-all-time-high.html), [Archive](https://archive.ph/8khYw)

RealEstate.co.nz spokesperson Vanessa Taylor said 12 years ago, the average asking price in New Zealand was around $410,000. It has now risen to a staggering $695,116. "The continuous increases in the national asking prices have largely been led by the Auckland region, but this month it was a diverse mix of eight other regions," Ms Taylor explained.

The areas which hit their all-time highs were Waikato, Gisborne, Wellington, Nelson and Bays, Otago, Southland, Central Northland and Manawatu/Whanganui.

Ms Taylor said these regions rose in price because they "experienced a fall in new listings, and have low overall stock levels, which has helped vendors command handsome prices".

## OECD: House prices biggest risk to New Zealand economy
Hamish Rutherford, 25 June 2019 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/113750716/oecd-report-urges-government-to-focus-on-supply-of-land), [Archive](https://archive.ph/FquJs)

On Tuesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its annual economic survey on New Zealand, which said that the country's wellbeing was "generally high", with strong employment prospects, health and social support. The report found New Zealand was weaker when it came to income and earnings, housing affordability and long working hours. New Zealand's housing market continued to be the biggest potential issue for the economy.

"The main domestic risk is a housing market correction, though there is no evidence of oversupply," the report said. "The effects of a contraction would be magnified by the elevated household debt levels resulting from sustained house price increases."

While the authors acknowledged a raft of measures were underway to increase supply, it pointed to other areas which created barriers, including planning legislation. "Strict regulatory containment policies still impede densification and should be replaced with rules that better align with desired outcomes," the report said.

## New Zealand scraps 'overly ambitious' plan to tackle housing crisis
Guardian staff, 04 September 2019 - [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/new-zealand-scraps-overly-ambitious-plan-to-tackle-housing-crisis), [Archive](https://archive.ph/gHlxa)

**Major climbdown as Jacinda Ardern’s flagship KiwiBuild policy, designed to provide affordable housing, is dumped**

In a major climb-down for the Labour coalition, the flagship KiwiBuild scheme, which was launched in 2018 by prime minister Jacinda Ardern, was dumped and the housing minister unveiled new policies for grappling with the nation’s housing crisis, with hundreds of Kiwis continuing to live in temporary, inadequate or unsafe housing around the country.

In June, Ardern replaced her housing minister and appointed a team of senior officials to fix New Zealand’s housing problems after KiwiBuild, the government’s flagship project for building 100,000 affordable homes in ten years, missed every several deadline. As of 4 September, the number of homes built was 258, according to KiwiBuild’s website – thousands less than the target.

Woods did not set any new target for KiwiBuild, saying the government would focus on building as many homes as it could, and targets had led to KiwiBuild homes being constructed in towns such as Wanaka that had no market for first-home buyers, and where they now languished empty for months.

The National party’s opposition spokesperson on housing, Judith Collins, said KiwiBuild was embarrassing and an utter fiasco, and KiwiBuild homes paid for by taxpayers would now be sold at a loss to property speculators or holiday home purchasers on the open market. “There were no new initiatives to speed up the delivery of houses. All we got from the new housing minister was a commitment to try harder. It’s meant to be KiwiBuild, not KiwiHope,” said Collins. “Labour talked a big game on housing but has failed to deliver meaningful change.”

New Zealand house prices are among the most unaffordable in the world, with Auckland the seventh most expensive city to buy a home, and all three major cities considered “severely unaffordable” by the latest Demographia international housing affordability survey. Prices have soared nationwide more than 50% over the past decade.

## Rapid house price growth creates a lot more Kiwi millionaires
RNZ Staff, 08 November 2019 - [RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/402864/rapid-house-price-growth-creates-a-lot-more-kiwi-millionaires), [Archive](https://archive.ph/gcBIZ)

A global wealth report has revealed that 185,000 New Zealanders - more than the population of Hamilton - can now claim to be millionaires in US dollar terms. According to Credit Suisse's 10th annual Global Wealth Report, this is up from 16,000 in 2010.

But Infometrics senior economist Brad Olsen said most of this wealth was locked up in property. "The really rapid house price growth we've seen over the last couple of years has been the key driver in that change around just how many Kiwis seem to be millionaires or not. "Certainly on paper they might be millionaires. In terms of whether they feel like millionaires in their homes, that might be a different picture."

Mr Olsen said while the richest 20 percent of New Zealanders have seen an increase in their net worth according the latest figures from Statistics New Zealand, the bottom 40 percent have stayed the same. "So the question is, yes we might have more millionaires, but is that because the economy been growing or because house prices have been growing? Is that prosperity being shared, or is it being concentrated in a certain group?"

## Sir John Key sells mansion for $23.5m in what was NZ's second biggest house sale of 2017
John Anthony, 17 December 2019 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/118217206/sir-john-key-sells-mansion-for-235m-in-what-was-nzs-second-biggest-house-sale-of-2017), [Archive](https://archive.ph/1T4DD)

Sir John Key has sold his Auckland mansion for $23.5 million, in what was New Zealand's second most expensive house sale of 2017. The property's most recent CV of $16m was issued by Auckland Council in July 2017, after it was bought by Chen. Annual rates for the property are more than $32,000.

Between 2014 and 2017 the mansion's CV increased nearly 50 per cent thanks to Auckland house prices soaring under a National government led by Key.

## New Zealand average house price tops $700k for first time
RNZ staff, 07 January 2020 - [RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/406829/new-zealand-average-house-price-tops-700k-for-first-time), [Archive](https://archive.ph/uaEgT)

Realestate.co.nz said the average asking price for a house in New Zealand had risen above $700,000 for the first time since records began 13 years ago. The average asking price is not a valuation, but an indication of current market sentiment.

Spokesperson Vanessa Taylor says regional New Zealand led the charge, with five regions showing substantial increases in average asking prices.

## New Zealand house prices jump in February, biggest increase in over four years - REINZ
Melanie Carroll, 12 March 2020 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/homed/real-estate/120209439/new-zealand-house-prices-jump-in-february-biggest-increase-in-over-four-years--reinz), [Archive](https://archive.ph/OjH1w)

New Zealand's median house price has risen $80,000 in a year to a record high of $640,000, the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand said on Thursday. That increase is well above the median wage of $52,000. Seven regions posted new record median prices.

"For two months in a row now we've seen every region in the country experience annual median price increases, showing a continuation of the price growth we started to see just before Christmas," said REINZ chief executive Bindi Norwell. The 14.3 per cent increase in the median house price last month was the largest percentage increase in 53 months.

Median house prices for New Zealand excluding Auckland increased by 11.8 per cent to a new record of $550,000, up from $492,000 in February 2019. In Auckland, median house prices increased by 4.3 per cent to $888,000, the highest price in 35 months and up from $851,000 a year earlier.

## An economy built on rising house prices: Is property our path to recovery?
Daniel Dunkley, 08 October 2020 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/opinion-analysis/300126229/an-economy-built-on-rising-house-prices-is-property-our-path-to-recovery), [Archive](https://archive.ph/Zuf4N)

Are soaring house prices good or bad in the middle of a global recession? Our political leaders seem unsure. At last week’s pre-election debate, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and National’s Judith Collins froze as they were asked a “gotcha” question: would they like to see property prices drop?

The two politicians danced around the issue under the studio lights. After a moment of deliberation, the risk-averse Ardern stressed she did not want prices to keep “escalating”. Pressed for more detail, she said she wanted the market to “stabilise”.

A recent statement from the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee suggests figures within the central bank view the buoyant housing market as a useful side-effect of recent decision-making. A summary of the Reserve Bank committee’s latest meeting read: “Some members noted that economic activity in New Zealand has historically been closely correlated with changes in household wealth, and that a stronger housing market may indicate a stronger recovery in consumer spending and residential construction if sustained.” In other words, higher house prices may boost confidence, making Kiwis more comfortable to go out and spend. If the price of their home is going up, people may be more likely to stimulate the economy.

## Auckland house prices: Buying frenzy tipped after Reserve Bank announcements
Ben Leahy, 12 November 2020 - [NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/auckland-house-prices-buying-frenzy-tipped-after-reserve-bank-announcements/3PY5Y6JZDGHUQAWIZZVHOEEDH4/), [Archive](https://archive.ph/Va8eo)

New Zealand's red-hot housing market could soar to unseen heights this summer as home buyers scramble to buy before tougher home loan lending rules are rushed back in. House prices were already running at record levels in recent months as houses sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars above council valuations and one Remuera home even fetched $4.4 million this week despite being described as a do-up. Now further fuel could be poured on the fire by two Reserve Bank announcements made yesterday.

The Government-backed bank said it was considering bringing back restrictions on so-called loan-to-value-ratios earlier than expected - a move pundits said could bring property investors rushing into the market in greater numbers. It also planned to lend more cheap money to commercial banks, meaning they would likely have more money to in turn lend to home buyers.

Put simply: the two powerful new incentives were likely to give house hunters and investors reason to buy sooner and potentially send prices hiking faster, Ray White Manukau real estate agency owner Tom Rawson said. "You'll see applications for home loan lending go through the roof and over the next few months it will just go nuts again," he said.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern recently expressed "worry" at the social impact of high house prices. New Zealand and Auckland hit record median sales prices of $685,000 and $955,000 in September, the Real Estate Institute said. The record prices seemed to be driven by all-time low-interest rates that made home loans cheaper and a "fear of missing out" among buyers.

However, independent economist Tony Alexander cautioned against overstating the importance of LVR restrictions. High-LVR lending only accounted for about one-fifth of total home loan lending in recent months. Alexander consequently expected that once LVR restrictions were back in place they would likely only cool house price growth for a few months. "I'd expect the market to slow down over March, April and May and take off again come June," he said.

## New Zealand reimposes lending curbs over housing bubble fears 
Jamie Smyth, 25 November 2020 - [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/c9d8caae-a7e3-4f14-8d6d-8743c12fd580), [Archive](https://archive.ph/Drcb7)

New Zealand’s central bank will reimpose mortgage lending restrictions from March amid concerns historically low interest rates are creating a housing bubble in the country. It follows an intervention by the newly elected Labour government, which wrote to the governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand asking the bank to consider house price “instability” when setting monetary policy. 

Residential property prices have surged by almost 20 per cent over the past 12 months, pushing the median price of a house in Auckland, New Zealand’s most populous city, above NZ$1m ($700,000) for the first time, industry data shows. Adrian Orr, RBNZ governor, said on Wednesday the bank would reimpose loan-to-value restrictions on lenders that it eased in May. Since then, he noted, there had been an increase in higher risk lending to property investors. 

The surge in house prices poses a political problem for the government of Jacinda Ardern, who pledged to tackle housing affordability during her first term in office. But housing supply remains tightly constrained, pushing up prices, while government plans to build 100,000 homes within a decade were dumped last year after only a few hundred houses were completed.

## Housing market bolts away: Auckland up 16.3% to hit $1m, NZ prices up 19.8%
Anne Gibson, 12 November 2020 - [NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/housing-market-bolts-away-auckland-up-163-to-hit-1m-nz-prices-up-198/F5R3TDOLRDZAY6E3D2IZYVZ62M/), [Archive](https://archive.ph/mqOj3)

New Zealand's super-charged housing market has rocketed even further ahead, with Auckland's median hitting $1 million for the first time. National prices have also risen almost 20 per cent in a year.

The Reserve Bank is being tipped to reintroduce loan-to-value ratios to restrict lending once again, as new Real Estate Institute data for October showed Auckland house prices bolted ahead 16.3 per cent annually from $860,000 to the new six-figure average. The national median shot up 19.8 per cent from $605,000 last year to $725,000 last month.

"October will go down in housing history as being the point in time when Auckland region's median house price hit the million-dollar mark for the first time – something no one anticipated or expected just six months after the entire country came out of lockdown," said REINZ chief executive Bindi Norwell.

Norwell worried about Auckland prices: "While this is a significant milestone, it raises serious questions around future affordability for Auckland residents wanting to get a foot on the property ladder."

The REINZ House Price Index for New Zealand, which measures changing values, increased 13.5 per cent annually to 3248. That is a new high for the index. The HPI for New Zealand excluding Auckland showed house price values increased 12 per cent from October 2019 to 3203 - also a new high.

## House prices to double in seven years, and there's nothing Jacinda Ardern can do about it - property expert 
Dan Satherly, 18 November 2020 - [Newshub](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/house-prices-to-double-in-seven-years-and-there-s-nothing-jacinda-ardern-can-do-about-it-property-expert.html), [Archive](https://archive.ph/R1nJd)

A property investment expert says New Zealand house prices will more than double in the next decade, and there's not a thing the Government can do about it. But Ashley Church, former head of the Property Institute of New Zealand, says that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

His comments come after data from both the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) and Trade Me found the median price of a home in Auckland is now more than $1 million and nationwide above $700,000. "House prices are going to continue to increase. Here's a prediction for you - in seven to 10 years' time, house prices around the country - the median house price will be at least twice what it is now," Church told The AM Show on Wednesday. "That's a reality. It doesn't matter what the Government does, it doesn't matter what the Reserve Bank does. We've got 50 years of empirical data that tell us that that's what's going to happen."

While many young Kiwis say they're being priced out of the market, Church says it's "not necessarily a bad thing for house prices to go up". "We're the fifth-wealthiest nation on the planet, and that's primarily because we have house prices that are stronger than they are in a lot of other countries. Provided the market doesn't crash - and it hasn't for the last 50 years - there's actually an argument that says house prices increasing are a good thing. It's about making sure that everybody can participate in that home ownership democracy."

Rather than the Government finding a fix, Church says prices will just keep going up until no one can afford to buy. "We will get to a point eventually where that equation simply gets too great - where the difference between what you're earning and what house prices cost is too great and it will be impossible to buy... That will be the moderator that will finally fix the market. The market fixes itself."

## PM Jacinda Ardern gets prickly over Marama Davidson's wealth tax comments, says she is 'concerned' over house prices 
Vita Molyneux, 23 November 2020 - [Newshub](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/pm-jacinda-ardern-gets-prickly-over-marama-davidson-s-wealth-tax-comments-says-she-is-concerned-over-house-prices.html), [Archive](https://archive.ph/48L0f)

**Jacinda Ardern says one of the things that sets her Government apart from the National Party is Labour's concern over skyrocketing house prices.**

The median house price in Aotearoa recently hit $750,000, and in Auckland it's soared past $1 million. In an interview with The AM Show on Monday, Ardern said she "has concerns" about New Zealand's housing market. "I don't want to see this ongoing escalation that is making it increasingly difficult to get first home buyers into houses, and that is something we're concerned about - and that's a different view to the previous Government."

She says when National were in Government "there was not particularly a view that escalating house prices were a problem". While she admitted the current market is unsustainable, she said "periods of plateaus" make it possible for people to pull together cash for a deposit to "try" and get into the housing market.

## Government forecasts five years of big house price growth but there is some good news
Thomas Coughlan, 16 December 2020 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300185131/government-forecasts-five-years-of-big-house-price-growth-but-there-is-some-good-news), [Archive](https://archive.ph/JYOH1)

Treasury has given Finance Minister Grant Robertson an early Christmas present in the form of a rosy economic outlook for the next four years, although a skyrocketing house price growth has forced the Government into announcing a housing package early in the new year. Do not expect a bargain in the housing market any time soon – in fact, housing will only become more unaffordable with prices rising at double the rate of wages.

Before the election, Treasury was forecasting a brief dip in house prices. Having been proved well and truly wrong, it is now expecting rampant house price growth over the next five years. Next year, prices are expected to grow four times faster than wages and five times faster than the economy as a whole, rising 8.5 per cent.

## New Zealand’s virus success unleashes runaway housing prices
Nick Perry, 25 February 2021 - [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-new-zealand-c88b705080e7cfc299581c568e705abd), [Archive](https://archive.ph/Rypn8)

New Zealand’s success in battling the coronavirus has unleashed an unanticipated problem: skyrocketing house prices. When the pandemic first hit, most experts predicted house prices would fall. Instead, prices have risen by more than 19% over the past year, putting them out of reach for many people wanting to buy their first home.

The median price of a home in January jumped to 730,000 New Zealand dollars ($544,000), a 19.3% increase from a year earlier, according to the latest figures from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand. In Auckland, the biggest city, the median price hit an eye-watering NZ$1 million.

Those prices are high under almost any comparison with other developed nations, especially considering most New Zealand homes do not come with double glazing, central heating or other features considered standard in much of North America and Europe.

## Housing affordability at worst point in 'at least 17 years'
Miriam Bell, 25 February 2021 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/homed/real-estate/124350937/housing-affordability-at-worst-point-in-at-least-17-years), [Archive](https://archive.ph/38fKk)

New housing affordability data shows the country's house price-to-income ratio has climbed to its equal highest point since data gathering began in 2004.

The latest CoreLogic Housing Affordability report puts the average house price-to-average household income ratio in the last quarter of 2020 at 6.8 nationally. That’s the highest level since late 2016 and in 2004, when it was also 6.8.

While Corelogic’s data only goes back to 2004, Davidson said his sense was that housing affordability was probably at its worst ever - even though mortgage rates in the 1980s were in the 20 per cent range.

## New Zealand moves to rein in runaway housing market with billion dollar plan
Elle Hunt, 22 March 2021 - [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/23/new-zealand-moves-to-rein-in-runaway-housing-market-with-billion-dollar-plan), [Archive](https://archive.ph/CEp94)

**Jacinda Ardern announces more support for first homebuyers and measures to dampen property speculation but admits its no ‘silver bullet’**

House prices have been driven up 23% in just 12 months, far ahead of wage growth, pushing younger and lower-income buyers out of the market. On Tuesday morning Ardern announced a package intended to address problems of housing supply and demand, and help shift the balance away from investors.
“New Zealand’s housing crisis is longstanding and will take time to turn around. There is no silver bullet … [but] the need for further action is clear,” said Ardern. “The last thing our economy and homeowners needs is a dangerous housing bubble, but a number of indicators point towards that risk.”

Measures have also been introduced to dampen speculation, after property investment reached record-highs due to low interest rates and New Zealand’s speedy economic recovery from the pandemic last year. In 2020 15,000 people who already owned five or more properties, bought houses.

The finance minister, Grant Robertson, announced an extension to the “bright-line test” – the holding time of investment properties to get tax offsets – from five to 10 years to curb the flipping of residential homes by speculators. New-build homes would be exempt to encourage more construction.

The government has also removed the ability for property investors to offset their interest expenses against their rental income when calculating tax. More loopholes that favoured investors would be closed, with the Reserve Bank due to report back on possible measures in May.

“Housing bubbles are unstable by their very nature, and we cannot afford to put the current economic recovery at risk by allowing house prices to spiral out of control,” said Robertson.

The International Monetary Fund warned earlier this month that New Zealand’s rising house prices were unsustainable and risked triggering an “eventual, pronounced correction”. The Reserve Bank had already tightened mortgage lending rules, and has been asked to consider housing while setting policies.

Almost 1% of the population is ranked as homeless or “severely housing deprived”. It’s the highest rate among OECD nations, and almost twice that of neighbouring Australia.

## NZ kills tax loophole on property to slow soaring house prices
Shane Wright, 23 March 2021 - [Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/nz-kills-tax-loophole-on-property-to-slow-soaring-house-prices-20210323-p57d9s.html), [Archive](https://archive.ph/e6pL6)

As part of a suite of measures the Ardern government says is aimed at keeping New Zealand houses affordable for first-time buyers, it will axe the ability of property investors to claim mortgage interest as a tax deduction against rental income.

House prices across New Zealand have soared over the past 12 months, even exceeding what has transpired in the Australian property market over the same period. According to the Real Estate Institute of NZ, the median house price in Auckland has soared by 24.3 per cent to $NZ1.1 million ($1 million). Across the rest of the nation, the median house price has increased by 19.1 per cent to $665,000 ($616,000).

Deputy PM and Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the recent increase in house prices was not only harmful to affordability but also a risk to economic stability. “The New Zealand housing market has become the least affordable in the OECD. Taking action is in everyone’s interests as continuing to allow unsustainable house price growth could lead to a negative hit to the whole economy,” he said.

## Budget 2021: Sharp house price adjustment coming, says Finance Minister
Melanie Carroll, 20 May 2021 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/125190227/budget-2021-sharp-house-price-adjustment-coming-says-finance-minister), [Archive](https://archive.ph/3kpz7)

The Government expects house price growth to slow dramatically by the middle of 2022 partly as a result of its housing tax policy changes announced earlier this year. In its economic outlook released in the Budget on Thursday, the Treasury forecast annual house price growth to peak at 17.3 per cent in the June 2021 quarter, and ease to 0.9 per cent by the June 2022 quarter.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson said it was a “very sharp adjustment in house prices, but a very necessary one”. However, house price rises were then expected to start picking up again.

Corelogic head of research Nick Goodall said the house price forecast was not a surprise. “We were expecting a slowdown to happen later this year, mostly due to the reintroduction of the 40 per cent deposit requirement for investors.”  House prices were not expected to fall, however.

“We don’t expect to see demand drop away so much that prices drop away, you should just see less price pressure pushing them up because you don’t quite have the same level of competition for the few properties that are for sale,” Goodall said.

Deloitte chief executive Thomas Pippos said the Budget suggested house prices have peaked. It was notable that house prices were not estimated to fall. Prices last declined during the Global Financial Crisis, he said. “Time will tell as the markets haven’t followed traditional thinking to date, in part because of a fall in interest rates and comparable yields, but it’s inevitable that gravity will halt pricing as some stage,” Pippos said in a statement.

In April, global financial ratings agency Standard and Poor's said it believed New Zealand house prices will “unwind in an orderly manner” in the coming year. However, there was a risk that the “unwinding” would not be orderly, and the Government’s measures to curb property price growth would lead to house prices falling excessively, S&P said.

Quotable Value general manager David Nagel said there was likely to be a cooling in house price growth in the second half of the year, but any significant change was unlikely soon. “Though most people would like to see property prices stabilise or even drop a little bit, nobody should want to see a long sharp drop. The effect of our housing bubble popping could be catastrophic – not just for the wider economy at large, but for the lives of normal everyday New Zealanders everywhere.”

## Average house price tops $1 million in Wellington
RNZ staff, 01 June 2021 - [RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/443827/average-house-price-tops-1-million-in-wellington), [Archive](https://archive.ph/KZIfC)

Average house values in the Wellington region have topped $1 million but the latest CoreLogic House Price Index shows some slowdown in the growth of those values. Nationally, values increased 2.2 percent in May, a slight reduction on April's 3.1 percent growth rate.

CoreLogic head of research Nick Goodall said that reflected the impact of both the Reserve Bank's tightening of loan-to-value ratios and the government's changes to the interest deductibility rules for residential investment properties.

CoreLogic said growth in values in Auckland was slowing, at 1.4 percent monthly and 5.5 percent quarterly. That put the average house value for the region over $1.25m.

## NZ number two in international house price growth ranks
Miriam Bell, 04 June 2021 - [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/homed/real-estate/125348365/nz-number-two-in-international-house-price-growth-ranks), [Archive](https://archive.ph/sE0U7)

House price growth in New Zealand is running at the second-fastest rate in the world, an international property consultancy says. The Knight Frank Global House Price Index shows that, in the first quarter of this year, house prices globally were up 7.3 per cent in the year to March 2021. New Zealand hit 22.1 per cent.

New Zealand’s rampant market has already attracted international attention this year. In April, Bloomberg reported it as one of the least affordable in the world, while the 2021 annual Demographia international housing affordability report ranked Auckland’s market as the fourth least affordable in the world.

## New Zealand commission launches inquiry into ‘massive human rights failure’ on housing
Tess McClure, 02 August 2021 - [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/02/new-zealand-commission-launches-inquiry-into-massive-human-rights-failure-on-housing), [Archive](https://archive.ph/aOnOz)

New Zealand’s housing crisis has become a “massive human rights failure”, the Human Rights Commission has said, as it launches a national inquiry into the problem. “Successive governments have failed New Zealanders,” chief commissioner Paul Hunt said in a statement as he announced the inquiry. “New Zealand governments have signed up to a critically important human right: the right to a decent home. For generations, they have promised to create the conditions to enable everyone to live in a decent home, but this has not happened.”

The national average asking price hit an all-time high of $893,794. Auckland is now considered one of the world’s least affordable housing markets, with median house prices about 10 times median income.

“For many people, especially young people, the goal of an affordable, healthy, accessible home has actually become more remote,’’ Hunt said. ‘‘These serial governments bear a heavy responsibility for this massive human rights failure, which is blighting lives and communities.

Last year, the United Nations’ special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Leilani Farha, visited New Zealand and called the housing situation there “a human rights crisis” and “a dark shadow that hangs over the country”.

## Cooling measures doing little to slow New Zealand's housing boom
Praveen Menon, 06 August 2021 - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cooling-measures-doing-little-slow-new-zealands-housing-boom-2021-08-06/), [Archive](https://archive.ph/mMCmP)

Desperation among homebuyers is pushing New Zealand house prices to record highs, overpowering the government's efforts to rein in the red-hot market and putting in jeopardy a key policy promise by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

Nearly 15,000 homes sold for more than NZ$1 million ($705,100) during the last 12 months, compared with just 5,500 in 2020, according to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand’s (REINZ) Million Dollar Price Report.

In the capital, Wellington, a 50-year-old derelict house deemed "too dangerous to enter" sold for almost NZ$1 million - a price far higher than expected.

"The new owners didn't step foot inside before purchasing it... even we could not enter," said Ben Atwill of real estate group Ray White, which made the sale. "From what I am seeing, there is no stopping the premium dollars from coming through."

Such runaway home prices have made New Zealand's property market one of the most unaffordable in the world, and measures introduced by the government and the central bank have so far done little to cool demand.

## New Zealand median house prices skyrocket 25 percent in a single year to new record high 
Matt Burrows, 12 August 2021 - [Newshub](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/money/2021/08/new-zealand-median-house-prices-skyrocket-25-percent-in-a-single-year-to-new-record-high.html), [Archive](https://archive.ph/t0o0a)

New Zealand's overheated property market has shattered another record, with house prices skyrocketing by more than 25 percent in the last year alone.

The latest data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) shows that in the 12 months to July 2021, median prices for residential property nationwide increased from $659,500 to $826,000. That eye-watering 25.2 percent rise represents an average capital gain of $166,500 for Kiwi homeowners - more than double what the average full-time employee earns annually.

Auckland again reached a new median house price record - $1.175 million, a 28 percent lift on the $918,000 it was at 12 months prior. "The region also saw a 2.2 percent increase from $1,150,000 in June 2021," REINZ explained in a press release.

REINZ's House Price Index (HPI) - an analytic tool measuring total housing market activity - increased 30.6 percent year-on-year to 3937 in July. That was a new high and the highest annual percentage increase since records began.

The July HPI result also marks the 14th consecutive month there's been a new high, which REINZ says shows the continued strength of the market.

## Bank makes prediction for when NZ house prices will start falling 
Dan Satherley & Caitlin Ellis, 17 August 2021 - [Newshub](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/money/2021/08/bank-makes-prediction-for-when-nz-house-prices-will-start-falling.html), [Archive](https://archive.ph/Eq066)

A major bank is picking house prices to start declining as interest rates "get back to something more like normal", and tax changes aimed at evening the playing field between owner-occupiers and investors come into force. 

But Westpac forecasts the declines won't come until 2023, and won't be anywhere near large enough to make up for the rapid price inflation of the last 18 months.

"We're expecting the cash rate to be going up in the coming months," Westpac chief economist Michael Gordon told Newshub. "Regardless of what happens with the decision on Wednesday - there's been speculation that it might not just be a 25 basis-point move, it might be 50 - either way I think we'll be looking at a cash rate of 1 percent by the end of this year, and further increases after that as the Reserve Bank looks to back out of the stimulus it put in place last year and get back to something more like normal."

Gordon said the low OCR, designed to encourage borrowing and investment, has been the biggest factor in the rapid rise in house prices. 

"A lot of the 30 percent rise in house prices we saw over the last year was really about those record-low mortgage rates… the shortage of housing was a factor, but that's not something that suddenly came on in the last year. It was very much about the low borrowing cost side of the equation. We think it will work quite strongly in the other direction too."

The most house prices will fall in a single year, according to Westpac, is about 4 percent. By 2025, they'll be stable or rising again.

## New Zealand Raises Interest Rates as Inflation, Housing Pressures Build
Stephen Wright, 06 October 2021 - [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-zealands-central-bank-raises-interest-rates-11633484873), [Archive](https://archive.ph/JZ2uo)

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifted its benchmark rate to 0.5% from a record-low 0.25% and signaled more increases over the next year, as it seeks to tame inflation stoked by higher oil prices, rising transport costs and supply-chain disruptions. It said the increase would also drive up mortgage rates and so help cool house prices, up about 30% over the past year.

New Zealand’s response to the pandemic ignited a local housing boom. The cost of building a new home was the biggest contributor to inflation in the three months through June, with companies reporting shortages of construction materials and rising labor costs. In March last year, the central bank lowered its cash rate by 0.75 percentage point to 0.25% to prop up activity. That made new home loans more attractive to owner-occupiers and speculators. New Zealand’s rise in median home prices over the past year is one of the fastest among the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The central bank in August projected the cash rate would reach 1.6% by the end of 2022 and 2.0% in the second half of 2023, though some economists doubt it will exceed 1.5%. New projections aren’t due until late November.

## Housing prices pose risk to New Zealand's financial stability, RBNZ governor says
RNZ staff, 02 November 2021 - [RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/454741/housing-prices-pose-risk-to-new-zealand-s-financial-stability-rbnz-governor-says), [Archive](https://archive.ph/qzGTJ)

In a speech at the Property Council of New Zealand's retail conference, the central bank's governor Adrian Orr said house prices are currently unsustainable and posed risks to the country's financial stability.

Homes in New Zealand are the most unaffordable among OECD nations, with prices soaring about 30 percent in 12 months due to an acute housing shortage, historically low interest rates and cheap access to capital from the government's pandemic-driven stimulus spending.

There was no one agency or silver bullet to fix the problem, with affordability and prices affected by not only supply and demand factors, but also immigration, tax policy, government benefits or transfers, land availability, building standards, infrastructure and training programmes, Orr said.

He also said the role of the Reserve Bank in the market was "bit part".

"We are one cause of demand changes as we alter interest rates to meet our monetary policy remit. We also work to limit mortgage lending when it appears excessively risky. However, this is more about limiting the damage to banks' balance sheets, rather than altering overall demand."

## Treasury predicts house prices to increase more than 10 pct in 2022
Zane Small, 15 December 2021 - [Newshub](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2021/12/treasury-predicts-house-prices-to-increase-more-than-10-pct-in-2022.html), [Archive](https://archive.ph/nrHRE)

New Zealand's lead advisor to the Government on economic and financial policy expects house prices to increase more than 10 percent in 2022 - after a 29 percent rise in 2021. Treasury's latest economic and fiscal update, known as HYEFU, shows house prices are forecast to increase 10.4 percent next year, meaning the median house price - currently $925,000 - will rise to more than $1 million. 

And it could be even worse. In Treasury's Budget update in May, it forecast house prices to rise by 17.3 percent, but its latest update shows prices went up by 29 percent. That means the 10.4 percent increase tipped for next year could prove to be a major underestimation. The 29 percent increase was the fastest since the 1980s. It occurred despite near-zero net migration and booming residential construction activity that increased supply. 

Home ownership rates have continued to fall - 44 percent of people aged 25 to 29 lived in owner-occupied homes, down from 61 percent in 1990. 

A recent survey by data insights firm Kantar showed two out of five Kiwis wanted the Government to forcibly bring down house prices. It reflected the latest Ipsos New Zealand Issues Monitor findings that showed housing was the top issue for Kiwis despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Infometrics says millennial first home buyers are signing up for a lifetime of debt and are likely to be much worse off than the baby boomers
Greg Niness, 23 June 2022 - [Interest](https://www.interest.co.nz/property/116461/infometrics-says-millennial-first-home-buyers-are-signing-lifetime-debt-and-are), [Archive](https://archive.ph/KlF8b)

In a new Housing Update report, Infometrics' Chief Forecaster Gareth Kiernan concludes that this year is the worst time for potential first home buyers to get into the housing market since 1957. Kiernan concludes that baby boomers fared much better from the housing market than today's first home buyers are likely to.

"Our analysis shows that even with mortgage rates below 5%, the average home's million dollar price means that today's first home buyers face much less favourable financial outcomes than a buyer in 1987 did with interest rates of 20%."

"Our analysis suggests that millennials wanting to enter the market now face the least attractive housing prognosis since their grandparents in the 1950s, if not longer," the report says.

## Big reversal in Wellington's house price fortunes as vast majority of suburbs dip

Few have escaped Wellington’s housing downturn as the vast majority of Wellington’s suburbs recorded a fall in price over the past three months.  Professionals Redcoats real estate agent Alice Pearson, who is also based in Lower Hutt, believed the figures understated the true decline. “What we’re seeing on the ground is closer to a fall between 15% and 20%,” she said.

Even a 5% decrease, it’s important to note, is a minor ding in the housing price armour. An equivalent decrease in Wellington City, for instance, would place the average house price at $1.13m – bringing prices back in line with April 2021.
